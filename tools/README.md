# Tools

This directory is dedicated to Go tools that are used during the development, testing, and building processes of this monorepo. These are typically command-line utilities or helper scripts that are not part of the main application logic but are essential for maintaining the project.

## Purpose

The `tools/` directory is used for:

- **Development Tools**: Linters, static analyzers, code generators, and other utilities that enhance developer experience.
- **Build-Time Dependencies**: Tools required by the `Makefile` or CI/CD pipelines.
- **Version Pinning**: By importing these tools in `tools.go`, their versions are managed by Go Modules, ensuring consistent tool versions across all development environments.

---

## Contents

- **`tools.go`**: This file is a standard Go convention for pinning tool dependencies. It contains `_` imports for all external tools used in the project. This ensures that `go mod tidy` and `go install` can correctly manage these tools.

---

## Usage

Tools are typically invoked via `go run` or through `Makefile` targets. This ensures that the correct version of the tool (as defined in `go.mod`) is used.

### Example Usage (from `Makefile`)

```makefile
# Example of running a tool defined in tools.go
lint:
    @go run honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck -checks=all ./...
```
