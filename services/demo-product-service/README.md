# Demo Product Service

This application is a placeholder for a future microservice responsible for managing product-related data.

## Current Status

This is a placeholder service. The current implementation only prints a "Hello" message to the console.

## Getting Started

You can run the service using the project's `Makefile` from the repository root.

```bash
# Run the service
make run APP=demo-product-service
```
