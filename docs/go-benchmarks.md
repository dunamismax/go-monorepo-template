# Go Benchmarks

## **Go's Official and Community Benchmarks**

The Go team itself maintains a suite of benchmarks to test the performance of the Go compiler and runtime. These are ideal for understanding how Go performs on your specific hardware.

- **[golang.org/x/benchmarks](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/benchmarks)**: This is the official repository for Go performance benchmarks. It includes a collection of benchmarks designed to test CPU and memory performance between different Go implementations. You can use the `benchstat` tool that comes with this package to compare results and highlight meaningful performance differences.

## **Third-Party Benchmark Suites**

Several open-source projects provide benchmark tests that you can run on your hardware:

- **[The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html)**: This is a well-known project that implements various algorithmic problems in many programming languages, including Go. It's a great way to see how Go's performance on your hardware compares to other languages for tasks like Mandelbrot set generation, n-body simulation, and more.

- **[smallnest/go-web-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/smallnest/go-web-framework-benchmark)**: If you're interested in the performance of Go for web applications, this GitHub repository provides a comprehensive benchmark for various Go web frameworks. It measures requests per second, latency, and memory usage under different loads.

- **[Phoronix Test Suite](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/)**: This is a comprehensive open-source testing and benchmarking platform. It includes a set of Go benchmarks that can be used to test aspects like JSON serialization, garbage collection, and HTTP performance on your specific hardware and operating system.
